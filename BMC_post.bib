abstract = {We have conducted a study on the long-term availability of bioinformatics Web services: an observation of 927 Web services published in the annual Nucleic Acids Research Web Server Issues between 2003 and 2009. We found that 72\% of Web sites are still available at the published addresses, only 9\% of services are completely unavailable. Older addresses often redirect to new pages. We checked the functionality of all available services: for 33\%, we could not test functionality because there was no example data or a related problem; 13\% were truly no longer working as expected; we could positively confirm functionality only for 45\% of all services. Additionally, we conducted a survey among 872 Web Server Issue corresponding authors; 274 replied. 78\% of all respondents indicate their services have been developed solely by students and researchers without a permanent position. Consequently, these services are in danger of falling into disrepair after the original developers move to another institution, and indeed, for 24\% of services, there is no plan for maintenance, according to the respondents. We introduce a Web service quality scoring system that correlates with the number of citations: services with a high score are cited 1.8 times more often than low-scoring services. We have identified key characteristics that are predictive of a service's survival, providing reviewers, editors, and Web service developers with the means to assess or improve Web services. A Web service conforming to these criteria receives more citations and provides more reliable service for its users. The most effective way of ensuring continued access to a service is a persistent Web address, offered either by the publishing journal, or created on the authors' own initiative, for example at http://bioweb.me. The community would benefit the most from a policy requiring any source code needed to reproduce results to be deposited in a public repository.},

@article{Wren2004,
abstract = {The advent of the World Wide Web has enabled unprecedented supplementation of traditional journal publications, allowing access to resources, such as video, sound, software, databases, datasets too large to publish, and even supplementary information and discussion. However, unlike traditional publications, continued availability of these online resources is not guaranteed. An automated survey was conducted to quantify the growth in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) published to date in MEDLINE abstracts, their current availability and distribution by journal.},

@article{Wilson2012,
abstract = {Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently. As a result, many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort. We describe a set of best practices for scientific software development that have solid foundations in research and experience, and that improve scientists' productivity and the reliability of their software.},
